## feeedback
Here is my feedback for the interview-
Not as strong as the role expectations in areas like
Dependency Injection and SpringBootDesign Software components for a simple systemExtensive AWS/Cloud knowledgeSystem & Technology application – When/where/why to use a technology
Expected more honest answers from Sandeep. A few instances are
When asked about DB scalability, he mentioned that he had worked on it. When I probed into the points brought up by him in the interview, Sandeep took back his statements.Data Lakes and its usages. He may have used it, but I did not get right answers.No instances where he could not collaborate or having different opinions with the other team members.TPS for the services – random and very high number was given
Mainly focused on his last project (Processing the data from Ibris system)
Did bring up some good points about Parallelism in Java, but would have been better if explained how it improved/optimized the system performance.Good knowledge in Oracle RDBMS concepts

Overall, I do not see him matching with the Senior level skillset.
