Introduction

Good morning x, nice to meet you. 

Introduction:
I am a backend Java developer in Verizon, MS now. I started my current job at Jan 2020. From my past experience, I had hands on experience on front end too.

I am working as a backend developer job.

Office of company, Madison, MS

Use Spring Boot to develop RESTful API services.

POJO: plain old Java Object.


4. My manager, Michelle R, Douglas.
5. Our team size is a little bit small. We had about three backend develper, two frontend developer, and one project manager.

6. Mainly we use postgreSQL.
7. For my team, normally we will have sprint planning, then distribute the work, we have stand up daily meeting, review the sprint, discussion about the challenge and progress. Before we work in office, we had meeting face to face. Since pandemic, we can work from home, we used teams or zoom sometimes. But recently, we start going back to office about three days a week.

8. My project is focused on the payment part of customers. Mainly focused on the monthly payment, and verizon service agreement, customers can purchase the data plan with two years service plan, they can purchase the phone with cheap price. Cost is about $30 to $40 a month based on the model of the cell phone selected. Also we using spring batch, process the refund of the customer.

9. My contribution mainly focused on the integration of the database with the server, maintain and upgrade the microservice.
   Verizon is a well developed company, I did not really develop new features. Just expand and upgrade current features to facilitate the customers to track the cost of their services.

10. The most challenge part: Spring Boot is a powerful tool for development of web application. At beginning, it is challenge for me to figure out how these backend works with front end, and how this interaction with database. Another challenge is the project deadline, sometimes the progress of each member is different, therefore the daily stand up meeting will help us to track the progress of each member. If necessary, we can reschedule the work or get some help for one part of the work to catch the progress of everyone.

What challenge you met in your project?
Design of the original project is not good enough to scale up, have to update or redesign.

Sometimes the project is not easy to push forward because the inconsistent progress among different groups.

Solve: understand the original design and extend it, or redesign so that later the interface could be more clear to sue.

Move forward, set meeting to understand other teams, coordinate about the block

1, Java Core
2, SpringBoot
作业题和分享的面经熟背，还有那本grokking的书。
能有一定的例子，比如bean of scope, singleton, 哪里，什么场景用到了singleton？
3，Microservice, kafka, cloud3, Algorithm
1)先讲自己对题意的理解，题意理解不了，就要clarify。
2）简单描述下自己思路中用什么算法和数据结构。
3）开始写算法，写的过程中要有一定的沟通。
4）一开始写的时候想下corner case并沟通。
5）要会自己写main 方法去test自己的算法。会构造不同的test case 去run自己的算法。
6）如果run时候报错，会debug，通常是包没导入，或语法错误。
7）注意自己的coding style 要美观。

能熟练写Singleton并讲清楚为啥那样写。
