## Diff bw relational db and non relational db



## which is more reliable 


## Diff bw StringBuffer and StringBuilder 
String buffer and StringBuilder both are mutable classes which can be used to do operation on string objects such as 
reverse of string, containing string and etc. We can moidfy string witout creating a new object of the string. A String
buffer is thread-safe wheras string builder is not thread-safe. 

Both use append, reverse
