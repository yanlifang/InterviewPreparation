## install python3-opencv 
https://installati.one/ubuntu/22.04/python3-opencv/

sudo apt-get -y install python3-opencv

When the installation finishes, you can check it has been installed correctly by running this command through Python IDLE or terminal:
python3 -c "import cv2"

If it returns any errors, It means the installation has failed, you need to fix it before using it, else, you can now start projects you want.
