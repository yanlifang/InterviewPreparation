Spring AOP is implemented in pure Java. No need for special compilation process.
Spring AOP does not need to control the class loader hierarchy, and is thus suitable for use in a J2EE web container or application server.

Spring AOP's approach to AOP differs from that of most other AOP frameworks. The aim is not to provide the most complete AOP implementation (although Spring AOP is quite capable); 
it is rather to provide a close integration between AOP implementation and Spring IoC to help solve common problems in enterprise applications.
