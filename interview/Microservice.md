## What is Microservice components? 

https://www.interviewbit.com/microservices-interview-questions/

Microservices, also known as Microservices Architecture, is basically an SDLC approach in which large applications are built as a collection of small functional modules. 
Widely adopted architectural concetps within software development. 

Pros: easy maintenance, development faster, big asset for the latest methods of software development such as DevOps and Agile, helps deliver large, complex applications promptly, frequently, and reliably. 

Applications are modeled as collections of services: 
1.  Maintainable and testable 
2.  Loosely coupled 
3.  Indepently deployable 
4.  Designed or organized around business capabilities 
5.  Managed by a small team 


## Main features of Microservices 
Decoupling
Componentization
Business capabilities
Autonomy
Continuous delivery
Responsibility
Decentralized governance 
Agility 

## Main components of Microservices 
1. Containers, clustering, and orchestration 
2. IoC - Infrastructure as Code Conception
3. Cloud Infrastructure 
4. API Gateway 
5. Enterprise Service Bus
6. Service Delivery 
   

Spring Cloud: system integrates with external systems. Short-lived framework designed to build applications quickly. Contributes SIG to microservice architecture due to its association with finite amounts of data processing.
