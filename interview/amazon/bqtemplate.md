S/T Situation/Task
Approach 
Results 

Whole genome sequencing, analyze sequencing myself, 
training others. Learn by myself 

## Dive deep
1. Couple years ago, we started our whole genome sequencing in our laboratory. It is not hard for us to do lab work,
like library prep and load samples to the system even without training. However, the WGS generated large amount of data. 
That is a challenge for us. I started learning and reading some papers and methods, to analyse these data by myself. 
Like how to filter data based on certain requirements, how to assemble the small reads to longer reads, and evaluate 
our assemble results. Although we did no provide commercial service yet, we run some projects for USDA and FDA. 
Share the raw data and analyze results to them. And write a protocol, train the technicians in the lab to do the work with easiest 
steps. 
2. First, appreciate the chance for this interview. My B.S. in CS, all the courses mainly use C++, and some of the course use JavaScript. 
So I don't know Java before. When I talked to some software engineers and start looking for some opportunies, I realized Java is widely used 
and there are more jobs are looking for Java Developers than others. Then I started learning Java and SpringBoot in past few months. 
Also I listened some lectures about Kafka, Microservies, docker. Tried to prepare myself in a better shape for a new positions and real challenge in the industry.

## Learn and be curious 
I guess based on my resume or studying experience. You can see I had lots of interests in different things. 
Before I started learning CS, I had a Ph.D in veterinary science. We mainly provide diagnostic services for in state and out of state clients. 
Actually I did pretty well in my fields too. I helped the lab start more than 30 new tests. But after everything is ready, not much new or innovation 
or challenge work to do. I have more free time, then I did some research then select OSU to study cs. It takes over 4 years, I am really like it. 
And due to the Covid, the lab is pretty busy. We participated some COVID test, so I decide to stay and keep doing a master. 
I will complete my master, and I wish I will have a chance to start my CS journey. 
Sometimes I have chance to learn in a new lab. I learned some tricks or better way to organize things and I tried to implement in my lab.


## Ownership 
I guess I just had one job in past over 9 years. I really take my ownership for my work from equipment maintenance, cost efficiency, save energy.
Make our clients happy. The revenue is not related with my salary, but I just like to do my best if I take the job. 
And our lab was promoted from level 2 lab to level 1 lab last year. I am really proud, but I wanna start some new journey. And go to a big places,
and work with variety of people. 

## 
Amazon: Speed matters in business. Many decisions and actions are reversible and do not need extensive study. We value calculated risk-taking. 
Instead of waiting for a perfect plan, managers should try out different things and see which one works best. 

## Bias for action 
Actually my boss gave me pretty decent privileges to make decisions on my section. Like if there are some new methods or new products available in the market,
I can buy and compare it with our current method. As long as the cost is not over certain limit. If the results are as good as I expected, I will share with me 
and proceed to start some new method or new reagents. 

I would recommend bias for action because it encourage entrepreneurs to think creatievely and to try new things to see what works best. This is important to 
discover better ways of doing things, which helps the company grow in the long run. 

Like our whole genome sequencing project, at beginning, we just provide service and share the raw data to other research group. 
I like analyze these data, and I wish we can offer the whole genome sequencign service in the future to client. 
I started did some research and compare the available softwares including free or charged, and easier ones to use. 
After extensive research and compare, I decide to use one workflow. Like the software used for denovo. filter, assemble. 
Then write a simple steps for people to follow, from how to start ubuntu in windows. 

example 2 
I can't say no one else see it. 
But not in my lab. We are clincial diagnostic lab, we collected hundreds thousands of positive samples. Normally we keep them 2 months, we get rid of them. 
One time talked with one start up company, they are looking for samples to validate their tests. I talked to my boss, maybe we can sell it to exchange get some reagents 
because we can't sell them for money directly. 

## Multitask were requested 
1. First considering the priority of each task 
how to decide the priority: communicate with manager or boss, time needed to complete the task, 
difficulty of the task, deadline, do i need extra support 

2. Analyze how long do you need to complete each task, can you complete by yourself on time,
If can't complete on time, let manager know ahead of time, to avoid the possible outcomes. If need extra support, ask support
   
3. Example 
Commercial projects, received the work request, because of the temp sensitive, we should complete in the same afternoon.
I will talk to my boss to get extra support in ahead, I will let people know if there are task to work next day. 
   
## what will you do if team member have conflicts or disagree 
One time we have Avian Influenza outbreak in US, I was deployed to UM lab for three weeks. 
I learned some experience to handle large amount of sample and streamline the workflow.
After I went back to the lab, I wanna try to change the way we do the work. 
You know what will happen. Some of technicians in the lab worked more years than I do, and noboy 
wanna have any change. It was struggle but I did not give up. 
I started try some new things as I planned, and we still keep some old way to do the work.
And I did use my new way, some coworkers realzied the new way is more efficiency and time saving,
finally they agree to change the new approach. 

And another case, I have different opinions with my boss. And I explained what I thought and my suggestion.
But he disagree, and he wanna insist in his way to do the work. So I follow 
his suggestions and approach to do the work. 

Sometimes I have chance to learn in a new lab. I learned some tricks or better way to organize things and I tried to implement in my lab.
Some of people work there much longer than I do, they don't wanna any changes to happen. So I started the new way from myself,
and explain how efficient of this new method is. When they realized the new way is more efficient, they started using the method. 

## Strength
Good at planning and scheduling. Like I have full time job, I arranged my work and my cs study organized. To make sure I can finish both work on time As good as possible.

## weakness 
I have obsession to finish my work as scheduled as I promised. If I realized it is possible to delay if I work normal hours, I might 
work extra hours, and try to speed myself a bit. Every time like this happens, I have to tell myself slow down and make sure everying
works right and every step is accurate. After these many years, I think I get less stressed before the deadlines, but still have a little bit. 


## work extra hours 
I understand. Sometimes it happens to work extra hours to catch the deadline. 
For my person work, I will try to schedule in ahead, and try to focus
 and complete within work hours. But if some urgent situations or plan changed, 
I have to wor some extra hours. I am ok with that too. 

I am reasonable flexible and if business needs are such that it would be advantages for me to work
longer hours - and even weekends, depending on my other commitments, I would certainly prepare to do so.
However, I would hope that this would be the exception rather than the rule. I do believe in a life outside 
of work, and while my job is clearly very important to me, I would generally like to keep 
working hours within normal bounds. 

My current job I have to work in emergency situations like big disease outbreak. 
If that happens, we not only work after hours, but weekends  or night shifts. 
But it is uncommon situations. 

## If boss made mistake, what to do 
It is pretty rare. My boss has over 30 years experience. But it does happen. 
One time we received a test request from one of the largest broker company owner, 
actually the sample we received was inappropriate. I talked to my boss, and we are not supposed
to run this samples. But he does not wanna ask the owner to resubmit. 
He wanna we run the samples, but it is a regulatory test. controlled by USDA.
I suggested to talk with USDA to get their ideas or permit. 
Then my boss called the person he knew from USDA, and get an deviation form to run that sample.

Case 2: 
For our results report system
We started some new business to do screening test for wild birds to check if there are AI or not
But the reporting system have three tests for each sample. 
We don't always need to have three tests, we only need 2nd or 3rd tests if 
first one is positive, Second and third will identify which flu it is. Like H5N1 or Swine Flu H1N1 
I talked to my boss, and show what happens if we don't have to run 2nd or 3rd tests. 
He agree with my ideas, and he talked with IT dept to change that.
Not directly his error, just the report system designed under his supervise. 

## What happens if your boss criticize you
It happens. When I was a Ph.D student, sometime my supervise are criticize my work 
or results are not as expected or did not come out on time. 
At begining, I did not schedule my work appropriately. You know some lab
work takes long hours to wait. Then I planned all my work and based on the waiting 
time for each task, I can schedule if I need to start something the day before I leave. 
Try to schedule the wating time in lunch time or multi taksing. 
When I am waiting for experiment 1 for two hours, I can work for something else if this 
needs less than 2 hours, or I will start experiment 2 within this time frame and 
for the waiting time when I go back to experiment 1. 

Example 2: 
For my current work, one time we changed one of the commericial kit we used from an individual 
test to a mixed test kit. The company changed the protocol and exclude one type of sample.
I haven't ask the IT dept to make that change from our website yet, 
then we received an emergency request, and they wanna results within 48 hours. 
My boss is unhappy with that because we have that listed in our website, but we actually are unable to do that.
I talked to my boss, and explain the situation. And I talked to the supplier company, 
they explain that is the same reagent. But it does not follow our SOP.
I talked to my boss, we sent to another lab for overnight testings. 
And the same time, I run the test in my lab too. And we get the results and report 
the results before deadline. 
After that, I rechecked all my SOPs periodically and update our website requirements 
based on any changes.
